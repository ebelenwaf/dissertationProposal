This section outlines some of the state of the art in the area of data provenance collection systems, data compression techniques for data provenance, and models for representing provenance data.


\section{Related Work on Provenance Collection Systems}

There has been a considerable amount of work done on data provenance collection \cite{_general-purpose_2012, bates_trustworthy_2015, gessiou_towards_2012, muniswamy_reddy_provenance_2010}. Some of the work done has been focused on databases, sensor networks, scientific workflow systems and file system provenance but so far little attention has been given to provenance in IoT. Some of the prior work done on data provenance collection are outlined below:

\subsection{Provenance Aware Storage System(PASS)}
MuniswamyReddy
et al \cite{muniswamy_reddy} developed a provenance collection system that tracks  system\-level provenance of the Linux file system. Provenance information
is stored in the same location as the file system for easy accessibility, backup,
restoration, and data management. Provenance information is collected and stored in
the kernel space. PASS is composed of 3 major components: provenance collector, and provenance storage, provenance query. The collector keeps track of system level provenance. It intercepts system calls which are translated into provenance data and initially stored in memory as inode cache. Provenance data is then transferred to a file system in an kernel database, BerkleyDB. This database maps key value pairs for provenance data for fast index look up. PASS collects and stores provenance information containing a reference to the executable that created the provenance data, input files, a description of hardware in which provenance data is produced, OS information, process environment, process parameters, and other/data such as a random number generator seed. PASS detects and eliminates cycles that might occur in provenance dependencies as a result of version avoidance. Cycles violates the dependency relationships between entities. For example, a child node could depend on a parent node and also be an ancestor of a parent node. PASS eliminates cycles by merging processes that might have led to the cycles. It also provides functionality for querying provenance data in the database. The query tool is built on top of BerkleyDB. For querying provenance, users can process queries using the provenance explorer. Query is done using commands such as MAKEFILE  GENERATION which creates the sequence of events that led to the final state of a file or process. DUMP ALL, gets the provenance of the requested file. 

\subsection{HiFi}
Bates et al. \cite{hi_fi}  developed system level provenance collection framework for the Linux kernel using Linux Provenance Modules(LPM), this framework tracks system level provenance such as interprocess communication, networking, and kernel activities. This is achieved by mediating access to kernel objects. Linux Security Model is a framework that was designed for providing custom access control into the Linux kernel. It consists of a set of hooks which is executed before access decision is made. LSM was designed to avoid problem created by direct system call interception. The provenance information collected from the kernel space is securely transmitted to the provenance recorder in the user space. 
\par HiFi contains three components, provenance collector, provenance log and provenance handler. The collector and log are contained in the kernel space while the handler is contained in the user space. The log is a storage medium which transmits the provenance data to the user space. The collector contains the LSM which resides the kernel space. The collector records provenance data and writes it to the provenance log. The handler intercepts the provenance record from the log. This approach to collecting provenance data differs from our work since we focus on embedded systems and are concerned with input and output (I/O) data, which primarily involve sensor and actuator readings.

\subsection{RecProv}

RecProv \cite{rec_prov} is a provenance system which records user-level provenance, avoiding the overhead incurred by kernel level provenance recording. It does not require changes to the kernel like most provenance monitoring systems. It uses mozilla rr to perform deterministic record and replay by monitoring system calls  and non deterministic input. Mozilla rr is a debugging tool for linux browser. It is developed for the deterministic recording and replaying of the firefox browser in linux. Recprov uses PTRACE\_PEEKDATA from PTRACE to access the derefrenced address of the traced process from the registers. It also ensure the integrity of provenance data up till the point at which a host is compromised by trace isolation. Mozilla rr relies on PTRACE which intercepts system calls during context switching. It uses PTRACE to monitor the CPU state during and after a system call. It uses PTRACE\_PEEKDATA from PTRACE to access the derefrenced address of the traced process from the registers. System calls such as execve, clone, fork, open, read, write, clode, dup, mmap, socket, connect, accept are monitored which are used for file versioning. The provenance information generated is converted into PROV-JSON, a W3C standard for relaying provenance and also stored provenance data in Neo4j a graph database for visualization and storage of provenance graphs. 

\subsection{StoryBook}
Spillance et al \cite{story} developed a user space provenance collection system, Storybook, which allows for the collection of provenance data from the user space thereby reducing performance overhead. This system takes a modular approach; It allows the use of application specific extensions allowing additions such as database provenance, system provenance, and web and email servers. It achieves provenance capture by using FUSE for system level provenance and MySQL for database level provenance capture. StoryBook allows developers to implement provenance inspectors these are custom provenance models which captures the provenance of specific applications which are often modified by different application(e.g web servers, databases). When an operation is performed on a data object, the appropriate provenance model is triggered and provenance data for that data object is captured. StoryBook stores provenance information such as open, close, read or write, application specific provenance, causality relationship between entities contained in the provenance system. Provenance data is stored in key value pairs using Fable as the storage backend. Storybook allows for provenance query. It achieves this by looking up an inode in the ino hashtable.



\subsection{Trustworthy whole system provenance for Linux kernel}

Bates et al \cite{bates_towards_2013} provide a security model for provenance collection in the linux kernel. This is achieved by creating a Linux Provenance Model(LPM). LPM serves as a security layer which provides a security abstraction for provenance data. It is involved in the attestation disclosure of the application layer and authentication channel for the network layer. The goal of LPM is to provide an end to end provenance capture system. LPM ensures the following security guarantees: For LPM,the system must be able to detect and avoid malicious forgery of provenance data. The system must be trusted and easily verifiable. \par When an application invokes a system call, the LPM tracks system level provenance which is transmitted to the provenance module via a buffer . The provenance module registers contains hooks which records system call events. These events are sent to a provenance recorder in the user space. The provenance recorder ensures that the provenance data is stored in the appropriate backend of choice. Provence recorders offer storage support for Gzip, PostGreSQL, Neo4j and SNAP.



\subsection{Towards Automated Collection of Application-Level Data Provenance}
Tariq et \cite{tariq_towards_2012} all developed a provenance collection system which automatically collects interprocess provenance of applications source code at run time. This takes a different approach from system level provenance capture. It achieves provenance capture by using LLVM compiler framework and SPADE provenance management system. LLVM is a framework that allows dynamic compilation techniques of applications written in C, C++, Objective-C, and Java. Provenance is inserted during compilation. LLVM contains an LLVM reporter. This is a java class that parses the output file collected from the LLVM tracer and forwards the provenance data collected to the SPADE Tracer. SPADE is a provenance management tool that allows for the transformation of domain specific activity into provenance data. The LLVM Tracer module tracks provenance at the exit and entry of each function. The output is an Open Provenance Model in which functions are represented by an OPM process, arguments and return values are represented as an OPM artifact. To minimize provenance record, users are allowed to specify what functions they would like to collect provenance information at run time. The LLVM optimizer generates a graph of the target application. This graph is used to perform reverse reachability analysis  from the functions contained in the graph. A workflow of how the framework works in collecting provenance is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The application is compiled and converted into bitcode using the LLVM C compiler, clang.

\item The LLVM Tracer module is compiled with bitcode.

\item Provenance instrumentation is added to the bitcode via the LLVM Trace module.

\item Instrumentation bitcode is converted into assembly code via the compiler llc

\item LLVM Tacer and Reporter is compiled into assembly code.

\item  The instrumented application and assembly code is compiled into an executable binary and sent to the SPADE kernel.
\end{itemize}

One major limitation to this approach of collecting application level provenance is that a user is required to have the source code of the specific application in which provenance data is required. Also, provenance collection is limited to function's exit and entry points.


\subsection{Provenance from Log Files: a BigData Problem}


Goshal et al \cite{ghoshal_provenance_2013} developed a framework for collecting provenance data from log files. They argue that log data contains vital information about a system and can be an important source of provenance information. Provenance is categorized based on two types: Process provenance and data provenance. Process provenance involves collecting provenance information of the process in which provenance is captured. Data provenance on the other hand describes the history of data involved in the execution of a process. Provenance is collected by using a rule based approach which consists of a set of rules defined in XML. The framework consists of three major components. The Rule engine which contains XML specifications for selecting, linking and remapping provenance objects from log files. The rule engine processes raw log files to structured Provence. There are three categories of rules as specified by the grammar. The match-set rules which selects provenance data based on a set of matching rules. Link Rules which specifies relationship between provenance events and Remap rules are used to specifying an alias for a provenance object. This component is integrated with the log processor. The Log processor component is involved with parsing log files with information contained in the rule engine. It converts every matching log information to a provenance graph representing entities(vertices) and their relationship(edges). The adapter converts the structured provenance generated by the Log processor into serialized XML format which is compatible with karma, a provenance service application that is employed for the storage and querying of the provenance data collected.




\subsection{Towards a Universal Data Provenance Framework using Dynamic Instrumentation}
Gessiou et al \cite{gessiou_towards_2012} propose a dynamic instrumentation framework for data provenance collection that is universal and does not incur the overhead of kernel or source code modifications. This is achieved by using DTrace, a dynamic instumentation utility that allows for the instrumentation of user-level and kernel-level code and with no overhead cost when disabled. It allows to be included at every point in time in a system  runtime without overhead issues from disabled probes.

The goal is to provide an easy extension to add provenance collection on any application regardless of its size or complexity. Provenance collection is implemented on the file system using PASS, on a database(SQLite) and a web browser(Safari). 
The logging component monitors all system calls for processes involved. The logging component contains information such as system-call arguments, return value, user id, process name, timestamp. The logging components includes functionalities to collect library and functional calls. The authors argue that applying data provenance to different layers of the software stack can provide varying levels of information. Provenance needs to be captured at the layer in which it is closest to the information that is needed to be captured. Provenance information that pertains to complex system activities such as a web browser or a database are collected. The information is collected from a process system-call and functional-call based on valid entry points contained in the process. DTrace dynamic instrumentation helps in discovering interesting paths in a system in which data propagates. This helps users use this information to collect a more accurate provenance data.


\subsection{Provenance-based trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks}
Lim et al. \cite{lim} developed a
model for calculating the trust of nodes contained in a sensor network by using data
provenance and data similarity as deciding factors to calculate trust. The value of
provenance signifies that the more similar a data value is, the higher the trust score.
Also, the more the provenance of similar values differ, the higher their trust score. The trust score of a system is affected by the trust score of the sensor that forwards data to the system. Provenance is determined by the path in which data travels through the sensor network. This work differs from our approach since the authors focus on creating a trust score
of nodes connected in a sensor network using data provenance and do not emphasize
how the provenance data is collected. We are focused on creating a
provenance aware system for I/O operations which is used to ensure trust of
connected devices. 

\subsection{Backtracking Intrusions}
Samuel et al \cite{King:2003:BI:945445.945467} developed a system, Backtracker, which generates an information flow of OS objects(e.g file, process) and events(e.g system call) in a computer system. From a detection point, information can be traced to pinpoint where a malicious attack occurred. The information flow represents a dependency graph which outlines the relationship between system events. Detection point is a point in which an intrusion was discovered. Time is included in the dependency between objects to reduce false dependencies. Time is denoted by an increasing counter. The time is recorded as the difference of when a system call is invoked till when it ends. Backtracker is composed of two major components: EventLogger and GraphGen. An EventLogger is responsible for generating system level event log for applications running on the system. EventLogger is implemented in two ways: using a virtual machine and also as a stand alone system. In a virtual machine, the application and OS is run within a virtual machine. The OS running inside of the virtual machine is known as the guest OS while the OS on the virtual machine is known as the host OS. The virtual machine alerts the EventLogger in the event that an application makes a system call and also when an application exits. EventLogger gets event information, object identities, dependency relationship between events from the virtual machine's monitor and also the virtual machine's physical memory. EventLogger stores the collected information as a compressed file. EventLogger can also be implemented as a stand alone system which is incorporated in an operating system. Virtual machine is preferred to a standalone system because of the use of virtual machine allows ReVirt to be leveraged. ReVirt enables the repay of instruction by instruction execution of virtual machines. This allows for whole information capture of workloads. After the information has been captured by the EventLogger, GraphGen is used to produce visualizations that outlines the dependencies between event and objects contained in the system. GraphGen also allows for pruning of data after it has been collected by the EventLogger. It contains regular expressions which are used to filter the dependency graph and prioritize important portions of the dependency graph.



\subsection{Provenance Recording for Services}
Grouth et al \cite{groth} developed a provenance collection system, PReServ which allows software developers to integrate provenance recording into their applications. They introduce P-assertion recording protocol as a way of monitoring process  documentation for Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) in the standard for grid systems. PreServ is the implementation of P-assertion recording protocol (PreP). PreP specifies how provenance can be recorded. PreServ contains a provenance store web service for recording and querying of p-assertions. P-assertions are provenance data generated by actors about the execution. It contains information about the messages sent and received as well as state of the message. PreServ is composed of three layers, the Message translator which is involved with converting all messages receive via HTTP request to XML format for the provenance store layer. It also determines which plug-in handle to route incoming request, the  Plug-Ins layer receives messages from the Message translator. It implements functionality that the Provenance Store component provides. This component allows third party developers to add new functionality to store provenance data without going through details of the code implementation. The backend component stores the P-assertions. Various backend implementations could be attached to the system by the plug-in component


\section{Related Work on Policy-based provenance data storage}

\subsection{Take Only What You Need: Leveraging Mandatory Access Control Policy to Reduce Provenance Storage Costs}

Bates et al \cite{Bates:2015:TOY:2814579.2814586} developed a system which allows maximizing provenance storage collection in the Linux OS environment using mandatory access control (MAC) policy. This enables avoiding the collection of unnecessary provenance data and only recording interesting provenance that is important to an application. In MAC system, every object contains a label and the MAC policy specifies interactions between different labels. Provenance policy contains security context which is enforced by the MAC policy and contains permissions based on security context. It also provides the connection between provenance and MAC. The authors argue that the system collects complete provenance without gaps in provenance relationship. This is achieved by extending the work of Vijayakumar et. al.’s \cite{asiaccs12-vijayakumar} Integrity Walls project which allows mining SELinux policies with the aim of finding Minimal Trusted Computing Base (MTCB) of various applications. A policy document is divided into trusted and untrusted labels. The trusted labels provides a thorough description of events relationship that can have access to the application. This information serves as a provenance policy that ensures a complete provenance relationship.

\subsection{A Provenance-aware policy language (cProvl) and a data traceability model (cProv) for the Cloud}

Ali et al \cite{Ali:2013:PPL:2569433.2569893} provides a provenance model, cProv, which illustrates the relationship between entities contained in a cloud system. This model is build on PROV notation. cProv contains 5 derived nodes(cprov:cProcess, cprov:Resource, cProv:Transition, cprov:cResource, and cprov:pResource ). There are a total of 10 edges built on the relationships contained in the PROV notation. Node consists of properties such as location, time-to-live, virtual-to physical mappings, executed operations. They also develop a policy language, cProvl that allows for access of provenance data. cProvl is represented in XML and consists of rules  and conditions that expresses logic to enforce access of resources. Each rule contains an entity. XACML, a policy language for the enforcement of access control is used for implementing access control on the provenance policy information. cProvl is mapped to XACML to allow the policy to run on XACML. An example of how the policy structure works is as follows: An application makes a request, this request is converted to an appropriate provenance aware request. This request is then forwarded to the policy engine. The request is evaluated by this layer by evaluating one or more policy rules as contained in a policy. This creates a response which is forwarded to the provenance converter that converts the request to an appropriate format for client utilization.



\section{Related Work on Data Compression}

\subsection{Secure Data Provenance Compression Using Arithmetic Coding in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN)}

The authors \cite{hussain_secure_2014} encode the provenance of the path in which a sensor provenance travels using arithmetic coding, a data compression algorithm. Arithmetic coding assigns intervals to a string of characters by  cumulative probabilities of each character contained in the string. It assign probabilities by monitoring the activities of the WSN, this is known as the training phase. In this phase the number of times a node appears in a packet is counted. Each node in the WSN is regarded as a symbol. This is used as input to the arithmetic coding algorithm which generates a variable interval for the combination of symbols. For their application, provenance is referred to as the path in which data travels to the BS. The WSN contains a Base Station(BS) and a network of nodes. The base station is in charge of verifying the integrity of the packets sent. It is also where the encoded characters using arithmetic coding are decoded.  According to the authors, provenance is divided into two types: Simple provenance in which data generated from the leaf nodes and are forwarded to surrounding nodes towards the Base Station. In the other form of provenance, data is aggregated at an aggregation node and forwarded to a BS. Each node in the WSN is represented as a string of characters and is encoded using arithmetic coding. The BS is responsible for decoding encoded provenance information. Provenance is encoded at the respective nodes and forwarded to the next node in the sensor network. The BS recovers characters the same way they were encoded. It also receives the encoded interval to which it uses to decode characters by using the probability values saved in its storage.
