\chapter*{Abstract}
The Internet of Things (IoT) offers immense benefits by
enabling devices to leverage networked resources to make intelligent
decisions. The numerous heterogeneous connected devices that exist throughout
the IoT system creates new security and privacy concerns. Some of these concerns can
be overcome through data trust, transparency, and integrity, which can be
achieved with data provenance. Data provenance, also known as data lineage, provides a history of transformations that occurs on a data object from the time it was created to its current state. Data provenance has been explored in the areas of scientific computing,  business, forensic analysis, and intrusion detection. Data provenance can help in detecting and mitigating malicious cyber attacks.  \par In this dissertation proposal, we explore the integration of provenance within the IoT. We take an in-depth look at the collection and use of provenance data in mitigating malicious attacks. We propose a provenance collection framework for IoT applications. We focus on a holistic approach in which provenance information is distributed throughout the IoT. We overcome the storage challenge of provenance collection by adopting a policy approach for provenance collection and storage which allows flexibility in deciding what provenance data to keep. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework by looking at an application of provenance data using an intrusion detection system, which detects malicious threats against IoT applications.
