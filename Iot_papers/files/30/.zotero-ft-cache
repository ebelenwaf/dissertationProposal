Abstract: 	The Provenance Aware Storage Systems project (PASS) currently collects system-level provenance by intercepting system calls in the Linux kernel and storing the provenance in a stackable ﬁlesystem. While this approach is reasonably efﬁcient, it suffers from two signiﬁcant drawbacks: each new revision of the kernel requires reintegration of PASS changes, the stability of which must be continually tested; also, the use of a stackable ﬁlesystem makes it difﬁcult to collect provenance
on root volumes, especially during early boot. In this paper we describe an approach to collecting system-level provenance from virtual guest machines running under the Xen hypervisor. We make the case that our approach alleviates the aforementioned difﬁculties and promotes adoption of provenance collection within cloud computing platforms.
