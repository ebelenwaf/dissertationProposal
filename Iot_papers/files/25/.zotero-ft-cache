Abstract: 

Most provenance capture takes place inside particular tools – a workflow engine, a database, an operating system, or an application. However, most users have an existing toolset – a collection of different tools that work well for their needs and with which they are comfortable. Currently, such users have limited ability to collect provenance without disrupting their work and changing environments, which most users are hesitant to do. Even users who are willing to adopt new tools, may realize limited benefit from provenance in those tools if they do not integrate with their entire environment, which may include multiple languages and frameworks.

We present the Core Provenance Library (CPL), a portable, multi-lingual library that application programmers can easily incorporate into a variety of tools to collect and integrate provenance. Although the manual instrumentation adds extra work for application programmers, we show that in most cases, the work is minimal, and the resulting system solves several problems that plague more constrained provenance collection systems.
