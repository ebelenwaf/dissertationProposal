Abstract

The importance of understanding the process by which a result was generated in an experiment is fundamental to science. Without such information, other scientists cannot replicate, validate, or duplicate an experiment. We define provenance as the process that led to a result. With large scale in-silico experiments, it becomes increasingly difficult for scientists to record process documentation that can be used to retrieve the provenance of a result. Provenance Recording for Services (PReServ) is a software package that allows developers to integrate process documentation recording into their applications. PReServ has been used by several applications and its performance has been benchmarked. 1
