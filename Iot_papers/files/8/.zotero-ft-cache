Abstract

Deterministic record and replay systems have widely been used in software debugging, failure diagnosis, and intrusion detection. In order to detect the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), online execution needs to be recorded with acceptable runtime overhead; then, investigators can analyze the replayed execution with heavy dynamic instrumentation. While most record and replay systems rely on kernel module or OS virtualization, those running at user space are favoured for being lighter weight and more portable without any of the changes needed for OS/Kernel virtualization. On the other hand, higher level provenance data at a higher level provides dynamic analysis with system causalities and hugely increases its efficiency. Considering both benefits, we propose a provenance-aware user space record and replay system, called RecProv . RecProv is designed to provide high provenance fidelity; specifically, with versioning files from the recorded trace logs and integrity protection to provenance data through real-time trace isolation. The collected provenance provides the high-level system dependency that helps pinpoint suspicious activities where further analysis can be applied. We show that RecProv is able to output accurate provenance in both visualized graph and W3C standardized PROV-JSON formats.
