\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary}
In this proposal, we motivate the need for integrating provenance into the IoT architecture. We propose a provenance collection framework that provides provenance collection capabilities for devices in the IoT. To address the scalability challenge of provenance storage, we also propose a  policy-based extension to our framework that provides efficient provenance data storage.

\section{Future Work}

Some of the proposed future work for this research is:
\begin{itemize}

\item Provenance collection raises privacy issues. How do we ensure that the vast amount of data collected is not invasive to privacy.

\item Provenance Versioning: Provenance version creates cycles. When a sensor-actuator data is read or edited, is a new instance of the file created? Tracking all transformations that occurs on a data object in memory constrained devices might lead to running out of storage space if each transformation creates a new copy of the object.

\item Securing Provenance: Proper encryption and authentication techniques \cite{Hasan:2009:CFP:1525908.1525909} are needed to ensure the confidentiality, and integrity of provenance data.

\end{itemize}
