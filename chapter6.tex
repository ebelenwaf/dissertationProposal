\section{Significance of the Result}

In this research, we present a provenance aware system that collects provenance information for IoT devices. This information can be beneficial in correcting and mitigating current and future attacks. We plan to continue refining our prototype, construct a model to guide data pruning, and create a taxonomy for secure data provenance in IoT systems that can inform our model.

endeavor.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}

\item Provenance collection raises privacy issues.How do we ensure that the vast amount of data collected is not invasive to the privacy of the use and also is not used as a tool to perform malicious attacks.
