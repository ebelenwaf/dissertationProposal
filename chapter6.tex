\section{Significance of the Result}

In this research, we present a provenance aware system that collects provenance information for IoT devices. This information can be beneficial in correcting and mitigating current and future attacks. We plan to continue refining our prototype, construct a model to guide data pruning, and create a taxonomy for secure data provenance in IoT systems that can inform our model.

endeavor.

\section{Future Work}

The problem now shifts to identifying new subclasses of the class of all
narrow-interval linear equation systems for which the problem of solving them
is possible with the development of new algorithms.  Also, if the general
problem (or any problem in the class NP) shows up often enough in industry,
science, research, etc., work on improving existing and/or creating new
approximation methods (including heuristic and/or statistical methods, where
applicable) is certainly warranted.  Since we cannot compute the exact bounds
for the general case, good approximation methodologies are the most we can
hope for or expect.
